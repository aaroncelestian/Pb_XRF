# Calibration Buttons Comparison Guide

## Overview of the Three Calibration Methods

The Parameters tab (Advanced Parameters) has three different calibration buttons. Here's what each one does:

---

## 1. üßÆ Create Calibration from Standards

### What It Does
Creates a calibration for **ONE element** by **manually entering** integrated intensities.

### Workflow
1. Select an element from the dropdown (e.g., Pb, Zn, Cu)
2. Click "üßÆ Create Calibration from Standards"
3. Dialog shows available reference materials for that element
4. **YOU manually enter** the integrated intensity for each standard
5. System creates calibration curve from your entered values

### When to Use
- You've already analyzed the spectra elsewhere
- You have integrated intensity values from another software
- You want to manually input specific intensity values
- You're doing quality control with known intensity values

### Example
For Lead (Pb):
- You select "Pb" from dropdown
- Click the button
- Dialog shows: NIST 2586 (432 ppm), NIST 2587 (3242 ppm), etc.
- You type in intensity values:
  - NIST 2586: 13,100 cps
  - NIST 2587: 98,500 cps
  - etc.
- System calculates: Concentration = slope √ó Intensity + intercept

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Manual input** of intensities
- ‚úÖ **Single element** at a time
- ‚úÖ Quick if you already have intensity values
- ‚ùå Requires you to analyze spectra separately

## 2. ü§ñ Auto-Calibrate Current Element

### What It Does
Creates a calibration for **ONE element** by **automatically analyzing** XRF spectrum files.

### Workflow
1. Select an element from the dropdown (e.g., Pb, Zn, Cu)
2. Click "ü§ñ Auto-Calibrate Current Element"
3. Dialog shows available reference materials for that element
4. **YOU select XRF spectrum files** for each standard
5. System automatically:
   - Loads each spectrum file
   - Fits the peak for that element
   - Calculates integrated intensity
   - Creates calibration curve

### When to Use
- You have XRF spectrum files for your standards
- You want the system to do the peak fitting automatically
- You're working with one element at a time
- You want to see detailed results for each standard

### Example
For Zinc (Zn):
- You select "Zn" from dropdown
- Click the button
- Dialog shows: Till 1, LKSD 1, PACS 2, etc.
- You select files:
  - Till 1 ‚Üí "Till1_spectrum.txt"
  - LKSD 1 ‚Üí "LKSD1_spectrum.txt"
  - etc.
- System analyzes each file, fits Zn peak, creates calibration

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Automatic peak fitting** and integration
- ‚úÖ **Single element** at a time
- ‚úÖ You just select files, system does the analysis
- ‚úÖ Shows detailed fit results for each standard
- ‚ùå Only calibrates one element per run

---

## 3. üöÄ Auto-Calibrate ALL Elements

### What It Does
Creates calibrations for **ALL elements** (up to 10) by **automatically analyzing** XRF spectrum files.

### Workflow
1. Click "üöÄ Auto-Calibrate ALL Elements" (no need to select element first)
2. System identifies which elements have enough standards (‚â•2)
3. Dialog shows ALL reference materials needed
4. **YOU select ONE spectrum file per reference material**
5. System automatically:
   - Analyzes ALL elements in EACH file
   - Fits peaks for Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, etc. in each spectrum
   - Creates calibration curves for ALL elements simultaneously
6. **NEW FEATURES** (just added):
   - ‚úÖ Checkboxes to select which standards to use
   - ‚úÖ Add custom standards with your own concentrations

### When to Use
- You want to calibrate multiple elements at once
- You have spectrum files for reference materials
- You want the most efficient workflow
- You're setting up the system for the first time
- You want to use custom standards or select specific standards

### Example
Full multi-element calibration:
- Click "üöÄ Auto-Calibrate ALL Elements"
- System shows: "Can calibrate 8 elements: Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Cr, As, Se"
- You see list of standards: NIST 2586, NIST 2587, Till 1, etc.
- **Check/uncheck** which standards you want to use
- **Add custom standards** if you have them
- Select ONE file per standard:
  - NIST 2586 ‚Üí "NIST2586_spectrum.txt"
  - NIST 2587 ‚Üí "NIST2587_spectrum.txt"
  - Custom Std ‚Üí "MyStandard_spectrum.txt"
- System analyzes:
  - Pb peak in each file ‚Üí creates Pb calibration
  - Zn peak in each file ‚Üí creates Zn calibration
  - Cu peak in each file ‚Üí creates Cu calibration
  - etc.
- Result: 8 calibrations created from one workflow!

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Calibrates ALL elements** at once
- ‚úÖ **Automatic peak fitting** for all elements
- ‚úÖ **Most efficient** - one file per standard, multiple calibrations
- ‚úÖ **Select which standards** to use (checkboxes)
- ‚úÖ **Add custom standards** with your own concentrations
- ‚úÖ Shows progress for each element
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires more reference materials (needs standards for multiple elements)
