# XRF Analysis Software - New Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

Two major features have been successfully implemented in the XRF Pb Analysis software:

1. **Y-Axis Auto-Scaling for Zoom** - Automatically adjusts Y-axis limits based on visible data
2. **Custom Calibration Manager** - Create calibration curves using your own NIST standards

---

## Feature 1: Y-Axis Auto-Scaling âœ…

### Problem Solved
Previously, when zooming into spectral regions, the Y-axis remained scaled to the entire spectrum range, making small peaks invisible.

### Solution Implemented
- **Automatic Y-scaling** based on data within the current X-zoom window
- **Preserves absolute intensity values** - critical for PPM calculations
- **Real-time updates** when using zoom controls or matplotlib toolbar

### How It Works
1. User zooms into an energy range (X-axis)
2. System identifies all data points (raw, fit, background) within that range
3. Y-limits calculated from min/max of visible data only
4. Plot updates with appropriate scale and 5% padding

### Key Benefits
- **Better visibility** of small peaks and background details
- **Preserved accuracy** for concentration calculations
- **Enhanced analysis capability** for low-intensity features
- **Seamless integration** with existing workflow

## Feature 2: Custom Calibration Manager âœ…

### Problem Solved
Users with their own NIST standards (SRM 2586, SRM 2587) wanted to create calibration curves from their own measurements rather than using the default NIST calibration.

### Solution Implemented
- **Comprehensive calibration dialog** with tabbed interface
- **Standards setup** for SRM 2586 (432 ppm) and SRM 2587 (3242 ppm)
- **Automated analysis** of multiple replicate files per standard
- **Statistical validation** with quality metrics
- **Save/load functionality** for calibration management

### Key Components

#### Standards Setup Tab
- Load multiple XRF files for each standard
- File management (add, remove, clear)
- Real-time analysis progress tracking
- Results display for each standard (mean intensity, RSD, etc.)

#### Calibration Results Tab
- Linear regression equation display
- Detailed statistics (R-squared, individual standard errors)
- Visual calibration plot with comparison to current NIST calibration
- Quality assessment and validation

#### Validation Tab
- R-squared quality rating (Excellent/Good/Acceptable/Poor)
- Standard recovery analysis (target: 95-105%)
- Precision assessment (RSD target: â‰¤5%)
- Overall recommendation for calibration use

### Quality Metrics
- **R-squared thresholds**: â‰¥0.995 (Excellent), â‰¥0.99 (Good), â‰¥0.98 (Acceptable)
- **Recovery limits**: 95-105% preferred, 90-110% acceptable
- **Precision targets**: RSD â‰¤5% preferred, â‰¤10% acceptable

### Integration Features
- **Seamless application** to existing analysis workflow
- **Updates calibration verification plot** with "Custom Calibration" label
- **Maintains all functionality** - batch processing, reporting, exports
- **JSON save format** for calibration sharing and backup

## Testing and Validation

### Example Files Created
- **6 synthetic standard files** generated for testing
- **SRM 2586**: 3 replicate files (432 ppm Pb)
- **SRM 2587**: 3 replicate files (3242 ppm Pb)

### Test Workflow
1. Load example standards using the Custom Calibration Manager
2. Run analysis to extract integrated intensities
3. Create calibration curve and validate quality
4. Compare with default NIST calibration
5. Apply custom calibration to analysis workflow

## User Workflow Impact

### Before Implementation
- **Y-axis scaling**: Manual adjustment needed to see small peaks
- **Calibration**: Fixed NIST calibration only, no customization possible

### After Implementation

- **Calibration**: Full control over calibration using own standards with validation

### Workflow Enhancement
1. **Load XRF files** as usual
2. **Zoom and explore** with automatic Y-scaling for better visibility
3. **Create custom calibration** using your NIST standards when needed
4. **Validate calibration quality** with built-in statistical tests
5. **Apply calibration** and continue analysis with improved accuracy
